Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `claude-code-3d`, state `waiting`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

Output exactly 6 full-body frames in one left-to-right row on flat pure blue #0000FF. Treat the row as 6 invisible equal-width slots: one centered complete pose per slot, evenly spaced, with no overlap, clipping, empty slots, labels, or borders.

Identity: same pet in every frame: 忠实保留橙陶色宽方形身体、两只方形白眼、左右短臂和恰好四只短足；整体是紧凑友好的 3D 桌面宠物，不增加嘴、瞳孔、文字、标志或道具。. Preserve silhouette, face, proportions, markings, palette, material, style, and props.
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `3d-toy`: Stylized 3D toy mascot with smooth rounded forms, simple materials, clear silhouette, and no photoreal complexity. User style notes: 哑光软胶或平滑陶土树脂玩具，轻微圆角倒角、可见实体厚度、克制的主体高光与暗面；近正面视角，缩小到 192x208 仍清晰。.
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Needs-input loop: expectant asking pose for approval, help, or user input.

State requirements:
- Show that Codex needs approval, help, or user input through an expectant asking pose.
- Keep the motion patient and readable, without turning it into ordinary idle or review.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.
